##Please note

The files here in bin/sdny are only of interest to me (david@davidmintz.org) in my peculiar environment here 
at the SDNY Interpreters Office, where we need to do things like import a ton of data from an existing database, 
scrape together a reasonably current list of judges and their courtrooms, and so forth. This stuff is kept in 
this repository just for my own convenience. :-)
