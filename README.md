# court-interpreters-office
web application for managing a busy US District Court interpreters office (useful only in the United States federal court system.)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Please note, this is not even close to fit for human consumption as yet. The only reasons I am making this a public repository are (1) because it's free, and (2) because the knowledge that anyone can inspect my source code will motivate me not to try not to embarrass myself.

At this writing, the repo is also empty of content aside from this file. The plan is to start adding things in the future.
