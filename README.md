a web application for managing busy US District Court interpreters offices (useful only in the United States federal court system).

At this writing, this repo has but little content and the application is not yet close to useable. The plan is to keep adding bits and pieces over time until I get the time to focus on it more or less exclusively and pick up the pace. The hope is to make it available to any of the US federal court interpreter offices who are interested in adopting it. The motivation is that there is no suitable software available, to my knowledge, for managing a busy staff court interpreters office. Our office has an application that I wrote, and it works well, but it needs updating and has too many baked-in features that are peculiar only to our needs. So this one will become the world's finest by far (the competition being pretty scarce).

It will be written in PHP and will rely heavily on [the Zend MVC Framework](http://framework.zend.com/); the [Doctrine Object Relational Mapper](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html); the [Bootstrap front-end framework](http://getbootstrap.com/), the [jQuery Javascript library](http://jquery.com/), and more.
