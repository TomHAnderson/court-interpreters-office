# court-interpreters-office
web application for managing a busy US District Court interpreters office (useful only in the United States federal court system).

At this writing, this repo has little or no content aside from this file. The plan is to start adding things in the future.

The only reasons I am making this a public repository are (1) it's free, and (2) the knowledge that anyone can inspect my source code should motivate me to try not to embarrass myself. The niche of possible users of this application, once we get it up here, is extremely small.
