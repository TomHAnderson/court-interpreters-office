# InterpretersOffice
a web application for managing busy US District Court interpreters offices (useful only in the United States federal court system).

The niche of possible users of this application is extremely small. Nonetheless I am making this a public repository because (1) it's free, and (2) the knowledge that anyone can inspect my source code will motivate me to try not to embarrass myself. 

At this writing, this repo has little content aside from this file. The application is not yet close to useable. The plan is to start adding things in the future.

# acknowledgments

It will be written in PHP and we plan to rely heavily on [the Zend MVC Framework](http://framework.zend.com/), the [Doctrine Object Relational Mapper](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html) the [Bootstrap front-end framework](http://getbootstrap.com/), the [jQuery Javascript library](http://jquery.com/), and more.
