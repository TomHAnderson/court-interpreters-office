<p class="mx-auto font-weight-bold">What is it?</p>
<p class="mx-auto pl-4"><span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span> is a web application for managing a busy court interpreters office
        &ndash; for example, a U.S. District Court in the United States' federal judiciary system.</p>
<p class="mx-auto font-weight-bold">What's so great about it?</p>
<p class="mx-auto pl-4">It has been developed over a number of years by a full-time staff court interpreter
    who is also a web developer, with input from his colleagues. With a solid basis in years of experience, it has been rigorously
    designed to make the administration of a high-volume court interpreters unit as pleasant and efficient as possible. We know of
no other product, commercial or otherwise, that is comparable.</p>
