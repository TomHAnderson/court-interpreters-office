        Court Interpreter Management System

<span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span> is an open-source web application for managing 
court interpreting &mdash; that is, a system for court interpreters and/or administrators to use to manage 
the scheduling of interpreters.

Developed over many years by the Interpreters of the US District Court, Southern District of New York, it 
came into being because there was nothing else available that served our needs. You're welcome to 
[read more about it]("./about.html").

The source code is freely available on [github](https://github.com/davidmintz/court-interpreters-office).

Prose documentation is still embryonic (as is this website), but we have begun documenting 
[the installation process](documentation/setup.html).

Feel free to [contact the developer]("./contact.html") with any questions.
